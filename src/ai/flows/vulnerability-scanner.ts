    prompt: `You are a cybersecurity expert simulating a web vulnerability scan for educational purposes. **You must not perform a real scan or access the provided URL.**

    Based on the provided URL, predict a list of common potential vulnerabilities.

    Target URL: {{{url}}}

    Instructions:
    1.  Analyze the URL structure and infer the likely technology stack (e.g., PHP, WordPress, Node.js, etc.).
    2.  Based on the inferred stack and general web security principles, generate a list of 5-7 common potential vulnerabilities.
    3.  For each finding, provide:
        - A clear vulnerability name (e.g., "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected").
        - A detailed but easy-to-understand description of what the vulnerability is.
        - A severity level ('Critical', 'High', 'Medium', 'Low', 'Informational').
        - A clear, actionable recommendation for how to fix or mitigate the vulnerability.
    4.  Generate a high-level summary of the website's likely security posture based on these simulated findings.
    5.  **Crucially, frame the entire response as an educational simulation.** Do not claim to have performed a real scan. Emphasize that these are *potential* issues.
    
    Example for target "http://example.com/login.php":
    - Infer PHP stack.
    - Potential findings might include: SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Outdated Dependencies, Weak Password Policies, etc.
    - The summary should state that these are common issues found in similar applications and that real testing would be required.
